# xing-api

This Haskell library is a wrapper for the [XING API](https://dev.xing.com).
It's currently under development and not considered stable

This repository includes a demo program called `CliDemo.hs`.
To use it, you have to obtain an API consumer key by registering your
application at [the XING developer portal](https://dev.xing.com/applications).
You have to put the consumer key and secret in the `Config.hs` file.
The `Config.hs.template` file is recommended to be used as a template.

    cp Config.hs.template Config.hs

This library is a private project and not associated with XING AG.
